# linux-imaging
Automated Linux Deployment System - Ubuntu 24.04

The goal of this project is to enable Zero touch imaging of Linux onto bare metal, enabling consistant configuration of each image profile.

This is mainly for use in my Proxmox Virtual Enviroment, as a way to quickly image VMs for testing and deployment purposes.

This project will use a collection of tools such as Ansible, Cloud-Init, iPXE
